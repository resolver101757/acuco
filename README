Pose estimation is of great importance in many computer vision applications: robot navigation, augmented reality, and many more. This process is based on finding correspondences between points in the real environment and their 2d image projection. This is usually a difficult step, and thus it is common to use synthetic or fiducial markers to make it easier.

One of the most popular approaches is the use of binary square fiducial markers. The main benefit of these markers is that a single marker provides enough correspondences (its four corners) to obtain the camera pose. Also, the inner binary codification makes them specially robust, allowing the possibility of applying error detection and correction techniques.

The following scripts will work when opencv is installed, follow the instructions here :

once installed, the live displays will work on the direct computer screen, not through SSH.
